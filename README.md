# Racecar-Modification-Simulator

A Backend for a car racing video game that realistically applies modifications to a base car and updates its performance.

Variables such as horsepower, traction, torque, total cost of the build, and more are all taken into account. Modifications (or upgrades) can 
be applied and some rely on other modifications and change the variables dynamically. 

Work in progress.
